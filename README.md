statgit
=======

_statgit_ is a PHP script to generate Git development statistics, 
similar to the statistics generated by [StatSVN](http://www.statsvn.org/)

_statgit_ uses [http://cloc.sourceforge.net/](cloc) to obtain lines of code, and this needs to
be installed.

_Note:_ This is under development, there is lots of data and statistics being collected and more reports
will be generated soon.

## Installing

1. Install php and [http://cloc.sourceforge.net/](cloc)
1. Clone _statgit_
1. Clone your target Git repository to a working directory, that statgit will interact with directly
1. Execute _statgit_ and wait

```
php -f statgit/statgit.php ~/openclerk --output ~/openclerk-stats/
```

### Examples

_Coming soon_
